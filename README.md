Basic C++ Programs, revised for use with C++11 (for first level C++ curriculum in college) 

Compile these programs using std -std=c++11 flag in g++,

<code> g++ -o prog.out prog_x.cpp -std=c++11 </code>  

you may choose your favorite modern compiler (that supports C++11) to run this program 

_Warning_: older compilers may not support newer C++11 features, so make sure you update your compiler or shift to a better one.
